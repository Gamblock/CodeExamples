# CodeExamples
This project contains examples of systems that I wrote for the most recent projects that I worked on.

* Become a queen (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/become-a-queen/id1604418225) is a narrative based hybrid casual game that is currently in a soft launch stage with over 7 million downloads. I have worked on it from the very first day in a team that had  2-4 developers depending on availiability and work load therefore I have participated in writing of almost all the systems. The systems presented in this project are all either written by me exclusively or include less than 10% of code written by other developers.
